> This training course will help you discover how the microServiceBus.com works and how you can using to build and manage your IoT solutions.

## [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md): Prepare yourself (tools etc)
Download and install the tools

## [Getting started](./GettingStarted.md): Build your first solution
This module will cover the basics how to create *Nodes*, *Flows* and *Services* into a complete solution.

## [Device Management](./ManageYourDevices.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
With our solution up and running, how do we manage the solution, track down and fix issues?

## [Working with Policies](./WorkingWithpolicies.md): Use policies to manage how your Nodes handle disconnected state
Disconnected state is common and something you need to plan for. Different solutions require different settings of how to handle network disruption.

## [Working with Templates](./WorkingWithTemplates.md): Simplify configuration of nodes
Using *Node Templates* will vastly simplify life when creating many nodes.


## [Insight and audit logs](./InsightAndAutitLogs.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
Looking through some more options and tools to identify problems.

## [Application Lifecycle Management](./ApplicationLifecycleManagement.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
Learn how we can manage *Scripts* in Github or VSTS.

## [microServiceBus.com API](./IntegratingWithMicroServiceBus): Integrate with microServiceBus.com API 
Many solutions require extended Device Management tasks to be preformed out-side the microServiceBus.com portal.
