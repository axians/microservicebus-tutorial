> This training course will help you discover how the microServiceBus.com works and how you can using to build and manage your IoT solutions.

## [Prerequisites](./Prerequisites.md): Prepare yourself (tools etc)
Download and install the tools

<hr/>

# DAY 1

## [Getting started](./GettingStarted.md): Build your first solution
This module will cover the basics how to create *Nodes*, *Flows* and *Services* into a complete solution.

## [Device Management](./ManageYourDevices.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
With our solution up and running, how do we manage the solution, track down and fix issues?

## [Working with Policies](./WorkingWithpolicies.md): Manage how your Nodes handle disconnected state
Disconnected state is common and something you need to plan for. Different solutions require different settings of how to handle network disruption.

## [Working with Templates](./WorkingWithTemplates.md): Simplify configuration of nodes
Using *Node Templates* will vastly simplify life when creating many nodes.


## [Insight and audit logs](./InsightAndAutitLogs.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
Looking through some more options and tools to identify problems.

## [Application Lifecycle Management](./ApplicationLifecycleManagement.md): Manage your devices and IoT Hub
Learn how we can manage *Scripts* in GitHub or VSTS.

## [microServiceBus.com API](./IntegratingWithMicroServiceBus.md): Integrate with microServiceBus.com API 
Many solutions require extended Device Management tasks to be preformed out-side the microServiceBus.com portal.
