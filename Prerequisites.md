Browse to https://nodejs.org and download and install the latest stable version of Node.js (LTS). Once installed, you should be able to run Node by opening a command prompt/terminal and type **“node”**. You are now in node, and can start typing JavaScript! Try typing ```console.log('Hello from Node.js')``` to verify it works. You can exit by closing the terminal or by hitting **CTRL+C** twice.
